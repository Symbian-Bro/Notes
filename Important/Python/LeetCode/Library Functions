Use stoi to convert a string to an integer and to_string to convert an integer to 
a string. Use stoll if the value is greater than INT_MAX of stoi. Assign the output 
to a long long variable for proper execution.

Example implementation of substring method to split strings :
{
std::string str = "Hello, World!";
std::string part = str.substr(7, 5); // start at index 7, length 5
}

Note : Added this because it will come in handy when you are performing the above 
stoi and such operations on large strings. Even stoll won't work on very long strings. 
So split them into parts and apply those methods.
