Use keyboard.hook instead of keyboard.on_press. It gives better low-level access.
Suppresssion is not working on Linux when (suppressed=True) is set as a parameter
to the keyboard module. So, do keyboard.hook(suppressed=True) instead. I do
not know what will happen on Windows. The keyboard module will work on Windows
even if you run it as a regular user iirc

The event.name of keyboard module will return long ass strings like Backspace, Enter, etc.
So, differentiate between these kinds of results and letters, use len(event.name)==1 to
check if it as letter or not. Treat these special keys as SPECIAL. Add a whole different 
code snippet to handle them.
