Use keyboard.hook instead of keyboard.on_press. It gives better low-level access.
Suppresssion is not working on Linux when (suppressed=True) is set as a parameter
to the keyboard module. So, do keyboard.hook(suppressed=True) instead. I do
not know what will happen on Windows. The keyboard module will work on Windows
even if you run it as a regular user iirc
